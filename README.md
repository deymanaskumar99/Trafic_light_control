# Trafic_light_control
Traffic control is a challenging problem in many cities. This is due to the large number of 
vehicles and the high dynamics of the traffic system. Poor traffic systems are the big reason for 
accidents, time losses. In this method of approach, it will reduce the waiting time of the vehicles 
at traffic signals. The hardware design has been developed using Verilog Hardware Description 
Language(HDL) programming. Verilog designing is hardware descriptive language, the name 
itself suggest that it deals with the hardware designing and simulation. Basically, it becomes 
very difficult to mount the various electronic components on breadboard or PCB circuit. It also 
takes too much time for the simulation and sometimes many errors occur because of improper 
connection of components onto the circuit. And thus, to overcome this factor hardware 
descriptive language comes into conclusion. We can code the process using Verilog and we 
can mount it on a circuit or just upload it to the circuit accordingly so that particular circuit will 
work as according to the code we have written. HDL language is often used for sequential 
circuits like shift register, combinational logic circuitlike adder, subtractor etc. Basically it 
describes the digital systems like microprocessor or a memory. Whatever design that is 
described in HDL are independent, it has its uniquestate of work, very much easy to simulate, 
designing and debugging, and very useful than schematics, especially for large circuits thus, to 
overcome difficulties or problems to designthe circuits manually with breadboard and PCB, 
use of Verilog designing in this complex world is increasing a way better.
